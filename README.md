# Description

Tasky is a simple yet powerful task manager. I found the usual tree structure to organize tasks far too rigid, so I came up with the idea that you can build your own tree on the fly with tags.


# Development

Clone this repository, install dependencies and run server (it requires Node.js)

    git clone git://github.com/jsilvestre/tasky.git
    cd tasky
    npm install
    npm run dev # start everything you need

**DISCLAMER**
Windows users, the build system assume that you can run the following UNIX commands:

* cat
* cp
* rm
* sed
* touch
* mkdir

If you have any trouble finding a solution, let me know you are intested, so we can look into it together.

# Contributing
Let me know what you would like to see in the application so we can discuss it. The simplest way to do it is [opening an issue](https://github.com/jsilvestre/tasky/issues/new).

Make sure there is not already an issue discussing the feature or the bug you are about to post about!
